I am a Research Fellow at Aalto University, Department of Electrical and Automation, working with Prof. Simo Särkkä. I am also affiliated with the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI) and serve as the Team Lead for the 'Physics-Informed Sustainable AI' group. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Tampere University, focusing on resilient distributed control and optimization of cyber-physical systems. Prior to that, I worked at the KIOS Center of Excellence, University of Cyprus, specializing in finite- and fixed-time control of multi-agent systems. I also served as a faculty member at the International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan. I earned my PhD from the University of Brunei Darussalam, where my research focused on the hierarchical structure and control of multi-agent systems.

My primary research area is distributed control and estimation. I focus on developing:
1. **Distributed filtering and smoothing algorithms**
2. **Secure distributed control and optimization algorithms**
3. **Physics-informed reinforcement learning methods**
